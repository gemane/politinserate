- PHP Version 5.2.13 with ZIP-Extension
- Zend 1.10. from http://www.zendframework.com
- Dojo 1.4.3

INSTALLATION
=======================================================================

1. Install Package from GitHub https://github.com/gemane/politinserate

2. Install Zend Framework in your include_path or symlink your 
   Zend Framework library into the library directory. 

3. Create empty folders with full read+write mode
   (use chmod 777 xyz in Unix for example)
    
    * data
        - cache
        - downloads (temp folder for downloads, e.g csv from tariff)
        - session
        - tarife (tariff file will be uploaded here)
            - temp (temporay folder for failed uploads)
        - uploads
            - images
                - original (original images from upload)
    
    * public
        - uploads
            - default (middle sized images)
            - thumbnail (small sized images)
    
    * temp
        - zf_log_info.txz (log file)

3. Create application.ini and config.ini from default files 
   in folder "/application/configs/"

4. Install database with files from "/docs/database/" 
   (prefix "acd_" means "Austrian Coding for Democracy")

5. Create a vhost that points its DocumentRoot to the public
   subdirectory. As an example:

    <VirtualHost *>
        DocumentRoot "/var/www/inserate/public"
        ServerName inserate.local

        <Directory "/var/www/inserate/public">
            Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
            AllowOverride All
            Order allow,deny
            Allow from all
        </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>
    

   In this particular example, we use the ServerName "inserate.local"; you
   will need to add this to your hosts file:

    127.0.0.1 inserate.local

6. Finally, simply fire your browser to:

    http://inserate.local/

CUSTOM DOJO BUILDS
=======================================================================
I have provided a profile for creating a custom Dojo build for 
the application. You will need a copy of the Dojo source and 
use the "/docs/dojo/inserate.profile.js" file to create the build.
